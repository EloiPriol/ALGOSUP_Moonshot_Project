# Moonshot Project 

## What Problem is the Project solving

  Over 1 Billion people in the world suffer from a disability, and in this Billion between 110-190 Million people have very significant difficulties in functioning; it should be fair to say that a similar number of people, while including people with those significant difficulties, have small to important difficulties when it comes to arm, hand and finger movement or strength.
  
  It has been estimated that around 3.1 Billion people play video games across the globe. So it is highly unlikely that none of those 3.1 Billion are apart of the estimated 110 to 190 Million people with upper body limbs and appendages' weakness.
  
  ***Unfortunately not a lot of help is directed to this minority in the gaming community when it comes to help them play video games with controlers like everyone and not for large amount of money for a custom made controller.***
  
  And another important part for the project is about gamers in general.  
  ***One of the biggest injury for gamers is tendonitis and tendonosis due to mainly using controlers wrong, a little bit had already been made to help prevent those injuries but I found a way to help at the same time both side of this project.***
  
  
## Why do I think this Problem is worth solving

  Making a controller from scratch would be fairly difficult to do and would nicely touch a lot of the subject I've learned during the entirety of my studies in ALGOSUP and in High School.
  
  To make my project as perfect as pssible I would need a software either on PC or Mobile, both if possible, which could be interresting, for the  software, to make and sharpen my knowledge

  A lot of people are cut out of a lot of things from the world just because they have some kind of disability and it is kind of unfair.  
  I also think there is no small step toward equality on whatever front, and that even just bringing small enjoyements in life to those who have to face difficulties their entire life is really important.
  
## How am I going to solve the problem.

### Hardware

  I am going to make 2 type of controllers, one arcade type controller and a more modern type one probably to the likes of the Nintendo Pro Controller.
  To do so I will be using [ARDUINO](https://www.arduino.cc) and [ARDUINO](https://www.arduino.cc) compatible hardware for everything linked to the hardware part of the controllers.
  
  For each button and trigger present on the controller, a force sensor will be put under it to detect the force input of the user, this is what will be used to detect an a press on the button.
  
  I will do my best to make it so most buttons and joysticks will be interchangeable on the user controller if the user needs bigger or smaller buttons or joysticks.
  
 Bluetooth will be used to receive changes to the functioning of the hardware thanks to a sofware
  
### Software

  A Software will be made to let the user change the inputs of their controller to whichever they want.
  
  They will also be able to decrease or increase the amount of force needed for each button or trigger to be considered ad a press and the amount of movement needed for the joystick to do to be considered as moved all the way.  
  This information will be send by bluetooth and the ARDUINO code will do the changes
  
  I am still unsure on what language I will use for the sofware. But I am still thinking about it and doing searches.
  If you want me to use a specific language of your choice for the software, I will be ready to do so
