# Moonshot Project 

## Main Objectives of the Project

  Over 1 Billion people in the world suffer from a disability, and in this Billion between 110-190 Million people have very significant difficulties in functioning; it should be fair to say that a similar number of people, while including people with those significant difficulties, have small to important difficulties when it comes to arm, hand and finger movement or strength.
  
  It has been estimated that around 3.1 Billion people play video games across the globe. So it is highly unlikely that none of those 3.1 Billion are apart of the estimated 110 to 190 Million people with upper body limbs and appendages' weakness.
  
  Unfortunately not a lot of help is directed to this minority in the gaming community when it comes to help them play video games like everyone and not for large amount of money for a custom made controller.
  
  And another important part for the project is about gamers in general.
  One of the biggest injury for gamers is tendonitis and tendonosis, a lot had already been made to help prevent those injuries but I found a way to help at the same time both side of this project.
